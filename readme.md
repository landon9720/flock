## a boot

This is a Scala/SBT wrapper around my original Java [project](http://code.google.com/p/kuhn/). One day I may port it to pure Scala (a way better language for these kinds of problems) (or better yet, ProcessingJS!).

Clone this git repo.

``` bash
sbt run
```

Blue boids are the  grazers in this world. They travel together, moving slow. They feed on â€¦ well, I am not sure. The hungrier they get, the slower they get.

This poor group is looking very hungry, indeed.

Here we meet the orange boids. As you can see, they are terrifying hunters.

Here we see another grizzly scene. Notice the rotting bodies? Those are food.

The green boids. They are the scavengers. The flies. They buzz and swarm. And keep me up at night.

Now meet the loan hunter: the yellow boid. He (or she) is the top predator of this world.
